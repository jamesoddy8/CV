I am a passionate and dynamic full stack developer who recently graduated Makers Academy. I have recently moved into tech after studying environment & development geography and working in Marketing & PR. Software development encompasses all of my interests: challenging environments with the potential to alleviate global issues; collaboration with people on exciting new ideas who and a continuous learning environment. I am looking for a role where I can strenghten what I have learned so far and continue to learn to enhance my knowledge of software development. 

## Skills

#### Communication

Through working in public relations, marketing and sales, I have been able to develop and refine both my verbal and written communication skills. Dealing with clients, journalists, collegues and memebrs of the public on a daily basis has taught me the value of good communication. 

#### Analytical

Through my studies in Geography I have been able to analyse and find solutions to problems, this was demonstrated in my end of year thesis for my masters where I analysed air pollution on the underground and discussed how best to solve this issue.

#### Adaptability

- Experience working under tight time frames remotely during the Covid-19 pandemic
