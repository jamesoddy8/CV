I am a passionate and dynamic developer who thrives under pressure and enjoys challenges. I am greatly interested in environmental & development geography and have experience working within marketing & PR. I am looking for a role where I can strenghen and enhance knowledge of programming. What excites me the most about tech is its potential to alleviate global issues such as poverty & environmental destruction.

## Skills

- Communication
- Analytical 

#### Communication

Through working in public relations, marketing and sales, I have been able to develop and refine both my verbal and written communication skills. Dealing with clients, journalists, collegues and memebrs of the public on a daily basis has taught me the value of good communication. 

#### Analytical

Through my studies in Geography I have been able to analyse and find solutions to problems, this was demonstrated in my end of year thesis for my masters where I analysed air pollution on the underground and discussed how best to solve this issue.
